## User Types and Workflow

BookSwap supports two types of users:

### 1. Book Owners
Users who list books they own and are willing to share:
- Register and create a profile
- Add books to their collection with details (title, author, condition, etc.)
- Review and respond to swap/borrow requests
- Track which books are currently loaned out
- Rate borrowers based on their experience

### 2. Book Borrowers
Users who want to borrow books from the community:
- Browse available books by category, author, or proximity
- Request to borrow books for a specific period
- Track their borrowing history and current loans
- Return books and mark transactions as complete
- Rate book owners and the book quality

### Typical Workflow:

1. **Registration**: Both types of users register on the platform
2. **Book Listing**: Book owners add their books to the platform
3. **Book Discovery**: Borrowers browse and search for books
4. **Borrow Request**: Borrower sends a request to the book owner
5. **Request Approval**: Owner reviews and approves/rejects the request
6. **Book Exchange**: Users meet in person or arrange shipping for the book

This peer-to-peer model creates a sustainable book-sharing community where both parties benefit from the exchange.
